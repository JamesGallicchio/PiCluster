PiCluster is a project I started the summer of 2017. The goal was to build (and program) a **computing cluster** from scratch.
This blog documents my progress and the project itself.

Updates on progress are filed under [`updates`]({{ site.baseurl }}/updates). Detailed posts about the hardware and software implementations are filed
under [`documentation`]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs).
