So, I've finally gotten around to finishing up some of the blog formatting and
updating my build files. I'm now getting started on a road map of all the
pieces that have to come together here. I'll have a documentation post up soon
about that road map!

Also on the to-do list is documentation of the physical build. Everything on
the hardware end is (quite surprisingly!) working, so it shouldn't take too
long.

The next few weeks will be busy for me, but I'll be putting more time into this
from now on.
